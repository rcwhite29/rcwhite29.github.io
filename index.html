                <p class="content">When most people ask what I study at the University of Maryland and I say “journalism,” they are usually surprised when they later find out that I am a volunteer member of a fire department. And when other volunteers ask what I study, they too tend to be surprised when I tell them I study journalism.</p>

                <p class="content">No one has yet to understand why I have pursued both and I did not fully understand why myself until recently. I enjoyed journalism and I was fascinated by emergency medicine. So, I studied both.</p>

                <p class="content">At the end of September 2020, I began training to become a licensed emergency medical technician. One of the first chapters in my textbook was about the importance of communication. The book explained how good communication was vital to being a successful EMT.</p>

                <p class="content">The first question an EMT asks their patient gets them an answer, which will prompt another question and another and another. They follow this trail of answers until the EMT has enough information to accurately predict what is going on inside their patient.</p>

                <p class="content">One of my journalism professors started out the semester by asking the class what we thought were the qualities that made a good journalist.</p>

                <p class="content"><span id="quote">“The best journalists ask the best questions,”</span> he said after the class shared our ideas.</p>

                <p class="content">I have come to realize that I enjoy both journalism and emergency medicine because they require the same fundamental skills in order to be successful. Both professions are concerned about the “why” of any situation because it will lead them to the answers they desire.</p>

                <p class="content">I am lucky. I have found two pursuits that I am incredibly passionate about. They satisfy all the right parts of my personality. And I am grateful that I have been able to combine the two.</p>

                <p class="content">I work as a staff writer for The Diamondback and although I do not cover fire to prevent a conflict of interest, I often get questions about anything relating to the department, specifically College Park Volunteer Fire Department - the company I belong to.</p>

                <p class="content">As with any industry specific language, it can be confusing. So, I took it upon myself to create a style guide that explains the terminology of CPVFD and the surrounding companies as well as some of the history behind those terms.</p>

                <p class="content">I truly believe I have a unique perspective on journalism because of my Fire/EMS background. It has given me an understanding of the fire beat and the two sharpen my skills of the other.</p>
